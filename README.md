        2.2. Develop a program which orders array of sales by amount. Input: array of objects with the following structure {amount: 10000, quantity: 10}. Output: new array of ordered sales with the same structure. Please note that input shall remain intact.
        2.3. Develop a program “Object Projection”. 
              Input: any JSON object; prototype object. 
              Output: projected object.
              Projected object structure shall be intersection of source object and prototype object structures. Values of properties in projected object shall be the same as values of respective properties in source object.
